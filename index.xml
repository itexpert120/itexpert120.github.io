      <description>Ok, this is gonna be last of the basic So far we have setup the linux install to be able to build, download the source. Now, we are going to build the ROM for our device so that we can flash it.
Setting the Env I&amp;rsquo;mma go straight into it and explaining as we go, go to the ROM directory where we synced it:
source build/envsetup.sh or:
. build/envsetup.sh Here is the breakdown, we are telling the shell to use that file to setup the enviormental variables to be able to start the build.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Ahh sh*t, here we go again&amp;rdquo; Ok so last time we made our linux install ready to be able to build android roms. Now we are going to download android source along with device specific sources.

So first
mkdir ~/bin PATH=~/bin:$PATH Then download it and make it executeable:</description>

      <description>Here we Go So you decided to build android yourself? Nice.
First things First: There are some requirments to build Android ROMs.
As Stated by Google:
 A 64-bit environment is required for Android 2.3.x (Gingerbread) and higher versions, including the master branch. You can compile older versions on 32-bit systems. At least 250GB of free disk space to check out the code and an extra 150 GB to build it.</description>
