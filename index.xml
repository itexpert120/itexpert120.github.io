      <description>Hi there My name is Muhammad Zeeshan Ahmad, more commonly known as @itexpert120 or @itexpert.120 (on XDA Developers).
I am a ummm&amp;hellip;. That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty complicated question even I&amp;rsquo;m trying to answer myself. Let&amp;rsquo;s start from begining, shall we?
I am an Android Developer, not an apps one but rather the OS one. I currently maintain a device known as Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime. I am also an aspiring Developer. I am also interested in Photography and Arts.</description>
