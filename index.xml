      <description>Hi there My name is Muhammad Zeeshan Ahmad, more commonly known as @itexpert120 or @itexpert.120 (on XDA Developers).
I am a ummm&amp;hellip;. That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty complicated question even I&amp;rsquo;m trying to answer myself. Let&amp;rsquo;s start from begining, shall we?
I am an Android Developer, not an apps one but rather the OS one. I currently maintain a device known as Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime. I am also an aspiring Developer. I am also interested in Photography and Arts.</description>

      <description>Here we Go So you decided to build android yourself? Nice.
First things First: There are some requirments to build Android ROMs.
As Stated by Google:
 A 64-bit environment is required for Android 2.3.x (Gingerbread) and higher versions, including the master branch. You can compile older versions on 32-bit systems. At least 250GB of free disk space to check out the code and an extra 150 GB to build it.</description>
