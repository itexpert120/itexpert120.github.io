      <description>Here we Go So you decided to build android yourself? Nice.
First things First: There are some requirments to build Android ROMs.
As Stated by Google:
 A 64-bit environment is required for Android 2.3.x (Gingerbread) and higher versions, including the master branch. You can compile older versions on 32-bit systems. At least 250GB of free disk space to check out the code and an extra 150 GB to build it.</description>
