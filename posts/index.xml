      <description>Here we Go&amp;hellip; again Ok so last time we made our linux install ready to be able to build android roms. Now we are going to download android source along with device specific sources.
Repo First we are going to download a tool called Repo made by Google. It alows us to manage multiple git repos all at once. Really nice tool.
So first
mkdir ~/bin PATH=~/bin:$PATH Then download it and make it executeable:</description>

      <description>Here we Go So you decided to build android yourself? Nice.
First things First: There are some requirments to build Android ROMs.
As Stated by Google:
 A 64-bit environment is required for Android 2.3.x (Gingerbread) and higher versions, including the master branch. You can compile older versions on 32-bit systems. At least 250GB of free disk space to check out the code and an extra 150 GB to build it.</description>
